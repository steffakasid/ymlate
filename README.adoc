= YMLATE

This project enables templating on yaml files in a helm like way. It could be an alternative to e.g. ytt and would make yml templating easier if you already know helm.

== Usage

Just run to get basic usage information:
[source, sh]
----
ymlate --help
----

== Templating

I've integrated link:https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/pkg/engine/funcs.go[] therefore nearly everything from helm is now possible to be done within templates. To get details about integrated functions check out link:https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/[here].

== Example Template

[source, yaml]
----
include::./testfiles/template.yml[]
