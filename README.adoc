= YMLATE (discontinued)

NOTE: I decided to not continue any work on this project, because I found out that there is already a pretty cool tool which can exactly this, with much more functionality. Therefore I recommend to use: https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate if you need a tool for templating yaml files.
