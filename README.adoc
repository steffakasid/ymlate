= YMLATE

My Plan is to create a simple tool which can template yaml files in a helm like way. It could be an alternative to e.g. ytt and would make yml templating easier if you already know helm.

== Usage

Just run to get basic usage information:
[source, sh]
----
ymlate --help
----

== Templating

For Templating currently you can do everything which is possible by link:https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[go templates].

Additionally until now I implemented the following functions available globally:

=== {{ toyaml <some object> }}

This function just takes the object and marshals it into yaml. The result is then placed as string into the current pipeline. E.g. `{{ toyaml .someObject }}`

=== {{ indent <indent depth> <some string> }}

This will basically indent the given string with the indent depth. E.g. `{{ indent 2 (toyaml .someObject) }}`

== Example Template

[source, yaml]
